Lead Form Best Practices
* Make Your Case
You need a strong Call to Action. Explain why filling out the form will be of benefit to your guest.
Make sure you know their pain points, and then make sure you have a compelling reason why filling out the form will help.

* Placement
Forms do best when they are above the fold and on the right-hand side of the page. This is sort of intuitive.
You want your guests to see the form, so it is best to keep it high enough on the page so most everyone can see it without scrolling down. Since most people read from left to right, forms get filled out more when they are on the right-hand side of the page

* Short vs. Long
This is a classic trade off between quantity and quality of leads. Be sure to ask for only the information you need!
We recommend that unless you have a compelling reason not to limit responses, simpler is always better.
Don't get greedy. Some reports have shown a 30% reduction in response rate by adding one required field beyond name, phone number, and email address.

* Save Submissions
Make sure your form is saving the entries to a database so you can export them into a spreadsheet.
As well as making your data exportable, this is a handy backup you can occasionally check to ensure you are not missing email notifications for submissions.

* Integrate with Mail Chimp or Constant Contact
These days there is no reason not to integrate your form with your email management software.
Keep it simple. So when your new lead clicks "add me to your newsletter" it is taken care of automatically.

* Email Notifications
Be sure to send your new lead an email that confirms you received their request.  This is a great opportunity to reinforce your brand. An immediate response to their request will show you appreciate and value them.

* Follow Up
Always respond to people who fill out the form, and do quickly so ideally, within one hour.
Few things will harm your brand image more than not responding to a lead gen form submission.
Remember is possible to have the form send information to more than one email address.
Be sure you have someone who will see the submissions and who will respond to them promptly.

* Skip the Captcha
No one likes to guess what letters and numbers those squiggly lines actually are, and if a guest fails the test even once, you can lose them.
We say, skip the captcha test unless you are getting a lot of spam, and we do mean a lot of it.

* Vertical vs. Horizontal
Vertical is preferred

* Inline Validation
* Consistent Lengths for similar fields
* Include link to privacy policy
* Echo the Call to Action of the Ad
* AutoFill Form Cursor
* AutoFill Form Input
