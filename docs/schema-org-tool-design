* Givens
Page content can be extracted from dom and indexed
Schema.org heirarchy tree can be indexed 
A HTML zipper of the page allows us to edit and traverse the dom.

* Ideas
As the zipper is used to walk traverse the tree each node is tested to see if is the type of node that would have semantic content.  If so the content of the node is searched agaisnt the schema-tree

* Concepts
** HTML Micro data
*** itemscope 
 cues in the search engine that what is encloused is about
a particular item
*** itemtype
this is a url to the schema of the type of item being scoped
*** itemprop
the attributes of the item

* Algorithm Steps

** Discovering items
** Scoping the items
** Determining item type
** Filling in attributes
** Embedding items
