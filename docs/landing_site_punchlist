So the issue is selecting the right domain,  market vector, landing-site, 
These pieces of data form the keys to create the correct cms object for use during 
the request.

The market vector id is determined by information encoded in the request:
  uri params
  uri path
  the default vector from the market matrix data

The landing site(s) can be found by examing the market-vector data

Domain Host - finds the directory for the market vectors and landinging sites
the domain may have many landing sites.  Each domain has a default market vector

Market vectors need to be able to have multiple landing site
each market vector has a default landing site
if A/B landing site (different from A/B of ads) testing is enabled a algorithm chooses the landing site to display

make sure the link is on the page
