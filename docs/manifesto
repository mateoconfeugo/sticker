Landing site system manifesto

ASSUMPTION: More qualified LEADS will lead to more CONVERSIONS
ASSUMPTION: CARRING THE SCENT and reducing the BAD STERORTYPE is going to lead to more LEADS
ASSUMPTION: Understanding the right aspects to use to taylor the experience to each user agent will cause more CONVERSIONS.
ASSUMPTION: Acturate profiling will cause more CONVERSIONS.
ASSUMPTION: Each actual DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE has a best way of delivering content via a LANDING SITE or VERTICAL SITE as to maximize the possible number of collected LEADS from that profile.
ASSUMPTION: How badly you have misprofiled some agent is quantifiable via BAD STEREOTYPE FACTOR.
ASSUMPTION: The smaller the BAD STEREOTYPE FACTOR an CAMPAGINS AD GROUP has the larger number of qualified LEADS will be collected.
ASSUMPTION: A agent request that has a projection along the DEMENSION PROFILE and always CONVERTS has a BAD STEREOTYPE FACTOR of 0.

GIVEN: The actual DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE versus the associated DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE represents the BAD STEREOTYPE FACTOR

The point of the LANDING SITE is to generate LEADS.  

A CONVERSION is a LEAD that ends up in a SALE.

LEADS will be generated by a user filling out a HTML form.

lThis data will be submitted in an ajax fashion to a web server that will log the the LEAD DATA in a database.

The data will also be piped to an automated Instant Message client or email client. 

These clients will route the data to the relevant party (call center reperesentive).

a CONTENT NETWORK is a set of VERTICAL SITES each specializing in some aspect that is going to drive traffic to a LANDING SITE.

VERTICAL SITES are composed of WEB PAGES.  WEB PAGES  are a set sequentially related web pages that CARRY THE SCENT in some way.  

VERTICAL SITES simulate PUBLISHERS pushing TRAFFIC to our LANDING SITE.

VERTICAL SITES use the same dynamic feedback that customizes the site experience for each USER.

TRAFFIC is also and more primarily pushed to the LANDING SITE via 3rd part AD-NETWORKS.  x

The LANDING SITE WEB APP (LSWA) is a hybrid single page/tradition web of pages programs in the form of a javascript app, json configs and the traditional html,css, image resources.

The CMS will publish the various site specific resources to the LANDING SITE BIZ SERVER (LSBS).

The LSBS job is service the tradtional http request along with the json rest channel that powers the single web page aspect of the LSWA.

The ADNETWORK TUPLE contains the  keyword, ad, and landing page metrics in relation to one another this object participates in determining the quality of how an ad is ultimately working.

The ADNETWORK gets WEB BROWSERS to point at the LANDING SITE this cause the LSWA to be loaded and open a two way asynchronos data messaging channel with the LSBS.

3rd party ADNETWORK's CAMPAGIN are organized in such a way to facilite the FLOURISH ONLINE A/B TESTING SUITE.  

The LSBS will service redirects to it.  These redirects wil be in the form of base_uri.com/[ad_network_id]/[campaign_id]/[ad_group_id]/[A|B|C].  This will allow the LSBS to know which of several COMPETING ads has caused the traffic.  The LSBS can uses this knowledge to up date the LSWA as well as alter the form of the HOSTING DOM for the LSWA.  

The LANDING SITE has a SITE MAP that intialialy has normal hyperlinks to normal webpages; however, after the javascript client part of the LSWA has uploaded the content of the tradtional html pages into the single page web app, these links are replaces so they cause the navigation show a different PAGELET.

A PAGELET simulates a traditional HTML page but rather than redirecting the users WEB BROWSER to a real URL ADDRESS, it servers as the replacement dom that the web app displays in page manner that looks identical to the traditional manner.

This set of relacement operations can be customized for each user based on demographic or ad related data.

The FLOURISH ONLINE A/B TESTING SUITE is a systematic way of improving the relevent metric.

Nomenclature of ADNETWORK CAMPAIGNS or the naming format.
[distributor grouping tag]-[type of campaign]-[demographic]-[conversion type]-[desired price per conversion]

The LANDING SITE itself has a part of the JSON API dedicated that allow  client programs to query, adjust, maintain, monitor alert the web app.  Data obtain this way can be used to ascertain the relevant and germane real time and other data.

The LANDING SITE itself has a part of the JSON API dedicated that allow a human admin user to gain relevent information or affect the LANDING site some manner.

Each AD-NETWORK Campaign is tied to a LANDING PAGE SITE.  Each site has a default dom host, javascript client single page web app and the default set of pages for the site.  

Each AD-GROUP in the CAMPAIGN is tied to a specific category in the site.  

These CATEGORY has pages that replace or auguement the default categories or parent categories stories(A/B).  Further each Category has custom tailored OFFER(s) associated with it 

Mapping a request into  DEMOGRAPHIC VECTORS so that the web application can use that offer to lure the user along and FLOW THE SCENT to the LEAD FORM and delivery them to correct DESTINATION SITE THANK YOU PAGE.

A POPULATION MATRIX consists of all the unique browser visits to either VERTICAL SITES or LANDING SITES on any partner.
A row vector in the POPULATION MATRIX represents on unique agent know to the FLOURISH ONLINE NETWORK
Each column in the POPULATION MATRIX represents a demographic dimension on how browser agents are quantified.

A PROFILING VECTOR particular set of DEMOGRAPHIC DIMENSIONS in the POPULATION MATRIX.

A  DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE  is the result of a  projection of a PROFILING VECTOR   against the POPULATION MATRIX.

A request coming into either a (LANDING SITE or VERTICAL SITE) server will server as a UNCATERGORIZED DEMOGRAPHIC VECTOR. 

The UNCATERGORIZED DEMOGRAPHIC VECTOR will be projected against the POPULATION MATRIX and the result will be put into the NEAREST tagged DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE.


Particular categories of the VERTICAL SITES or LANDING Sites are mapped to specific categories of the forementioned sites.

Thus when a request comes into a VERTICAL SITE or LANDING SITE gets PROFILED and thus provide the key that maps to  the correct category.  The LSBS.  

The DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE  is encoded in the AD-NETWORK LISTING AD destination uri.

How the TRAFFIC INSTANCE enters either LANDING SITE or VERTICAL SITE tells us what DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE was associated with that ad.

Feedback is used by monitoring the result of A/B testing so decrease the BAD STEREOTYPE FACTOR and also find what the actual DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE is for a particular campaign.

This adusting to statify a criteria will converge to find the RESOUNANT FREQUENCY that LINKS the KEYWORD SET (keyword bucket), Ad, and Landing Site that best CARRIES THE SCENT such that the ads receive the best possible quality rating.

It seems wise to have one CAMPAGIN linked to one LANDING SITE to one DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE.  

The different aspects of the DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE are targeted and serviced via the associated CATEGORIES.

Each LANDING SITE can support multiple demographic and CAMPAGINS.


The LANDING SITE BIZ SERVER hosts multiple LANDING SITES and thus MARKET VECTORS.



TACTICAL

Each customer gets the following:
* Virtual debian instance
* github repository
* cms site 
* mysql database server

The physical files that make up CMS driven Single Page Web Application come from two places
1) The Catalyst JSON REST server and the Javascript Client Graphical User Interface - comes from github
2) The content pushed into the servers filesystem from the CMS to be used by the server - comes from the cms server

Release Process Mechanism
1) cpanm using the new github and versioning features
2) publishing from bricolage using bric_soap
3) cronjob that runs every ten minutes running 1 and 2

Landing Site Biz Server REST API

by the time the LSWA is using the api it has a session cookie

/api/rest/
	 page 
	 config/
	 profile/
	 offer/

Incoming HTTP Request Cycle.

The underlying idea is that the url is going to be used to determine what batch of resources are going to be linked together.
These links form a customized site for the individual browser/cookie.  A further driving force is the accounting aspect associated 
with crediting the correct source of traffic.

Decoded url information http://[domain-name]/ad-network/1/campaign/1/ad_group/1/listing/A
token = 111A

the token is associated with a marketing vector via a look up table.
The marketing vector id serves as an index into the site_matrix data structure to get more granular information.
* demographic profile
* offer 
* keywords

account=>1,
ad_network=>1,
campaign=>1,
ad_group=>1,
listing=>A,
market_vector=>1
demographic_profile=>1
offer=>1

based on all this info the session is populated and the site is rendered using the correct set of urls. 
The response contains the session cookie, the host dom with robot indexable links, and the javascript single page web app

Lead Generation Form Request Cycle

The browser has gotten to the lead generation form and submitted the information.
The information is saved in the database and the user is redirected to the specified 
url in the market vector.
