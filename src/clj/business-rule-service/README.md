# business-rule-service

A Clojure based service designed to seperate out business rules from the mechanics of the system.  Most of this is just stubbed out but the idea is that functionality principle exposed to the clojurescript client via the shoreleave remoting api will have a hook that makes sure that the api operation and data  adheres to and is manipulated via these pluggable rules.
