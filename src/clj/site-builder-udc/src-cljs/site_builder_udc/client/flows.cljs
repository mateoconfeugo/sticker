;; This is where we wire the information flow for our application
;; You can think of this like routing, but for the client side app.
;;
;; Using pubsub, functions, atoms, storages - *anything* can
;; publish and subscribe to each other.
;; For example, the return values of functions are published to
;; the bus and passed along to any of the subscribers.
;;
;; Here's diagram of what's happening below:
;;
;;     Button Click
;;      \---> Fn returning a map
;;             \---> Updating local storage with the new map
;;              \      \---> Sending a message back to the server
;;               \      \     \---> Echoing the response to the console
;;                \      \                                      \---> popping up an alert
;;                 \      \---> Echoing LS to the console        \---> echo the value of :kitchen-sink from ls
;;                  \---> Print out to console
